# Task 5: Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

## Objective
Capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark to identify key protocols and understand packet structures.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark

## Steps Performed
- Installed Wireshark on Kali Linux.
- Started capture on the active network interface.
- Generated traffic by visiting websites and using terminal tools.
- Applied protocol filters (HTTP, DNS, TCP) to analyze traffic.
- Identified at least 3 protocols and studied packet details.
- Exported capture as a `.pcap` file.
- Created a summary report of findings.

## Outcome
Gained practical experience with packet capture and protocol analysis. Understood how various protocols interact in real time over a network.
